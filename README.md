# Leaflet_Challenge
Leaflet Challenge

SUMMARY:

This project uses Leaflet to create a map that plots earthquakes from the last 7 days.  

The size of each plot point has a direct correlation to how large the magnitude of the earthquake was.  Also, the color of the plot point is based on how deep
(in meters) beneath the earthâ€™s surface that the earthquake occurred.

There are three layers (grayscale, terrain, & satellite) and there are two different geoJson data sets that are pulled in.  One of them plots the earthquakes
and the other one plots the tectonic plate lines.

Lastly, there is a legend that shows what the different colors mean with respect to each plot point.

Thank you for taking a look at my project!
